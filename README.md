## ⚒ Bio ⚒

 I'm not studying at the moment. I've been working for myself for a year now. Started programming at the age of 16, started with Python, then jumped to C++, because I liked hardcoding even then. 

 I didn't list C++ in my Skills list because I don't think I can write fluently in it. 

 I like to solve unusual tasks, do things that haven't been done yet, optimize workflows.

 For a long time worked as a computer wizard, then as a system administrator, for a total of 2 years.

 Mainly focused on API, Back-End, Microservices, Bots, Parsers, worked with WinApi a little, but it was cool.

 I'm a connoisseur of old culture, the same Hacking times which I didn't catch... 

## Hobby
